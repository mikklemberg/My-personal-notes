There was [a discussion on Twitter about opinionated software](https://x.com/brian_lovin/status/1793132504033157218) that got me thinking about design-led companies.

I’ve been thinking about this concept for some time, and [Julian Lehr’s comments](https://x.com/julianlehr/status/1793566676895584605) about purpose-built software instead of opinionated software solidified my thoughts.

Great products are designed for a purpose.

They are designed to support the specific needs and workflows of specific professions.

To develop purpose-built software, you need to understand the people who use it. Talk to them, observe their workflows and gather insights. [Great example from Elicit team](https://blog.elicit.com/living-documents-ai-ux/).

[Design-led companies](https://blog.mikklemberg.ee/design-led-companies.html) know that simplicity is not about leaving out features, but about developing solutions that fit seamlessly into people's lives.

By staying connected to your users and putting their needs first, you can develop software that not only solves problems, but also brings joy and helps people.

Purpose-built software is a testament to thoughtful design and [a deep commitment to usability](https://blog.mikklemberg.ee/design-beautiful-business.html).
