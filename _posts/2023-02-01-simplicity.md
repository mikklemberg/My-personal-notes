Bear the burden of complexity. Work hard to make things simpler for others.

On the product side, internalize complexity so your customers benefit from simplicity.

Customer happiness (as a result of an improved customer experience) is a simple metric that everyone can rally around.

On the people's side, keep your messages simple, so everyone understands them.
