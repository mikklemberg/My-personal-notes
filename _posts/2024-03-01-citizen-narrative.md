A few weeks ago, I wrote about focusing on books dealing with systemic change (https://blog.mikklemberg.ee/18-months-reading.html). Usually, they're driven by various levels of government through politics.

Since then, I've come across a fresh perspective that resonates profoundly, mainly through the book "Citizens (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60651047-citizens)" and Jon Alexander's articles here (https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-be-an-engaged-citizen-and-make-meaningful-social-change) and here (https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220803-citizen-future-why-we-need-a-new-story-of-self-and-society).

Our societies are shaped by two main narratives: the consumer story and the story of subjects.

Since the 1970s, the consumer narrative has dominated, promoting the idea that our primary goal is consumption. The consumer narrative has become deeply ingrained in our consciousness. It implies that by pursuing our self-interest, we're contributing to the greater good of society.

But in reality, the consumption narrative has led to pervasive inequality, ecological collapse, and social isolation (loneliness pandemic).

This narrative also suggests that our individual choices, such as using a reusable cup or taking shorter showers, are the extent of our influence on the world's problems. Even voting is seen as a mere expression of personal preference.

The subject story takes us back to a time when people were subjects of a ruler. The leader was entrusted with making the best decisions for everyone, and the rest of us were considered too naïve to understand complex issues.

This narrative was the norm for centuries.

However, in the face of current uncertainties, the theme is gaining traction again. It suggests that people are searching for a strong leader with all the answers. In times of danger, the temptation for someone else to take charge becomes ever more significant, which explains the resurgence of this narrative.

The author of the book "Citizens" believes that limiting ourselves to these two narratives prevents us from solving the global problems at hand.

But when we understand these deep narratives, we can see beyond their limitations. Then, we can reclaim our power, not just as consumers or subjects, but as active shapers of our society and future.

They propose a "citizens' story" in which we work together to solve global problems.

Changing the narrative can be a decisive response to the climate catastrophe by reshaping how society perceives and addresses environmental challenges. Changing the narrative can shift collective behavior and policy, which is essential to effectively tackling the climate crisis. (https://blog.mikklemberg.ee/narratives.html)

It's exciting that if we see our current crisis as a crisis of narrative, we can recognize that we all have the power to change it. This power goes far beyond voting in the supermarket or at the ballot box.

The citizen story framework positions us as active, engaged members of society who shape the world together.

The citizen story encourages:
- Empowerment over helplessness: It motivates individuals to believe they can impact climate change.
- Responsibility over consumerism: It promotes sustainable living to reduce environmental footprints.
- Collective action: It highlights the importance of working together, stressing our interdependence.
- Responsibility and care: It calls for individuals to care for society and the environment.
- Climate action with social justice: It connects fighting climate change with achieving fair treatment for all.
- Community involvement: It sees citizens as active participants in shaping their communities.
- Democratic participation: It supports active engagement in democracy and community decision-making.

The narrative is based on the belief that citizens can bring about meaningful social change and tackle global challenges such as inequality and climate change.

This narrative contrasts with change at the government and policy level, which focuses on formal structures. Narrative change is about changing cultural mindsets that lead to new actions. In contrast, systematic change is about concrete institutional changes implemented through legislation and policy.
