title: "18 months of books about design, urbanism and climate disaster"

Over the past 18 months, [I have focused on reading](https://mikklemberg.ee/books) about urban design, new design philosophies to address climate disaster, and anthropology.

During that time, I have read over 16 books. I have summarized some of them into notes and insights; others are still on my to-do list. When I finished reading “[Regeneration](https://regeneration.org/the-book)" and “[Streetfight](http://www.jsadikkhan.com/streetfight-the-book.html)" a few weeks ago, I asked myself what I wanted to read next.

Reading all those books has clarified what we need to do to address climate disasters and why. I also understand the underlying currents that have brought us to this point. I started wondering about how to bring all these ideas and changes to life.

I was inspired by “[Life-sized City: Lessons for Futureproofing Our Urban World](https://youtu.be/oJzA0Aiw4kI)." There is also a talk by [Dan Hill on strategic design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo6hC-MaEJQ) that encourages thinking more systematically and trying to lift all boats, if possible, by dealing with broader systems.

At the moment, I am less fascinated by taking the entrepreneurial path to fix a specific problem or ignite change with some initiative. Moreover, the private sector cannot do the job of the public sector. I am curious about systemic change, which could come from different levels of government through policy or politics.

On that note, I have picked a new book, “[How to Make an Entrepreneurial State: Why Innovation Needs Bureaucracy](https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300227277/how-to-make-an-entrepreneurial-state/)."

[While watching the authors present the book](https://youtu.be/29aosKq90mA), I already learned many valuable lessons about effecting change and encouraging innovation in the public sector. I look forward to exploring the book's promised historical context, scholarly analysis, and case studies on successful global initiatives.

I am particularly interested in cities and the urban environment. Everyone, not just the most privileged, should be able to live where they can access everything they need for a good life. This includes good public spaces, low-carbon mobility, biodiverse nature, and a socially well-functioning environment.

Climate change makes people feel like they have to choose between "saving the planet" and their happiness, well-being, and prosperity.

If we want the majority of humanity to end the climate crisis, the way to do so is counterintuitive: to reverse global warming, we need to address people's current needs. If we want to get people's attention, they need to feel that their concerns are being addressed.

We must alleviate poverty, tackle unsustainable lifestyles in higher-income countries, achieve social justice, provide universal healthcare, and make education accessible.

Here's a list of books that I feel like reading right now:
- "Street Commerce" by Andres Sevtsuk
- "The Architecture of Community" by Leon Krier
- "The Disobedience of Design: Radical Thinkers in Design" by Gui Bonsiepe
- "Shikake: The Japanese Art of Shaping Behavior Through Design" by Naohiro Matsumura
- "Small is Beautiful" by E. F. Schumacher
- "Politics of the Everyday (Designing in Dark Times)" by Ezio Manzini
- "Emergent Tokyo: Designing the Spontaneous City" by Jorge Almazán
