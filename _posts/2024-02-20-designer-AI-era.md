In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and large learning models (LLMs), many professions are reassessing their futures, especially as new startups emerge daily with the aim of replacing engineers, product managers, designers, and other jobs.

I have some loose notes from a designer's perspective. Having recently written about [how design contributes to beautiful (successful) products](https://blog.mikklemberg.ee/design-beautiful-business.html), my current take is optimistic, highlighting the increasing role of designers.

**I**

The advent of LLMs capable of writing code and automating software development prompts the question of how businesses can maintain a competitive edge.

I believe that overall business strategy, supporting systems, and user experience will become the moat against competitors, not just the ability to ship new features quickly.

Designers who develop a profound understanding of AI capabilities will play a crucial role in envisioning and implementing these strategic decisions.

**II**

It seems that people will increasingly rely on AI tools to provide perfect summaries, answers, or solutions, rather than seeking out original sources.

In an API-first internet, the user interface becomes the battleground for supremacy. The winners will be those whose interfaces integrate seamlessly into existing workflows and introduce novel, transformative interfaces that users love to engage with.

Designers driven by empathy for user problems and workflows will be the ones to discover those novel interactions that customers ultimately choose to engage with.

**III**

As AI takes on more routine tasks, the value of human input shifts toward taste. In a world where AI-generated content becomes commonplace, taste becomes a scarce and invaluable commodity.

But as Steve Jobs once said, "I don’t think my taste in aesthetics is that much different from a lot of other people’s. The difference is that I just get to be really stubborn about making things as good as we all know they can be. That’s the only difference."

What does great taste look like in the AI era?

I don't have an answer for that, but a great place to develop a taste for the AI era is joining an established company with significant existing data and product workflows that could be enhanced by recent AI advances.

Instead of joining a startup to develop a new AI foundational model, I think designers are at the moment best placed to improve existing products with AI-based workflows.
