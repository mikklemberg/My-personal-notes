The terrain of American mental health is as vast and colorful as this country’s geography. I’ve been interested in exploring the landscape since 2019, when I dashed off a quick blog post on cultural differences in psychology. Backburnered for four years, the topic is now top of mind for me. My interest in the economies of cultural and spiritual production, the topic of Life After Lifestyle, led me right back to mental health and wellness. But there are many other cues that point me this direction. Something weird is clearly happening with American psychology.
One major factor is the expansion of diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the DSM-IV and DSM-V, which have helped make trauma into a singularly dominant cultural complex. While other disorder categories have undergone similar expansions, obsessive-compulsive disorders and anxiety disorders among them, trauma is unavoidable: it can be personal, generational, and cultural. My eyebrows always raise when I see a cultural concept get consolidated, reified, and applied to many categories. Such homogenization is often the precursor to a paradigm-breaking concept.
