To move faster, write concise explanations. Present your ideas in simple terms, with strength and clarity. That way they can be remixed, revised, or built upon.

Concise explanations:
- spread faster because they are easier to read and understand;
- accelerate decision-making;
- make ideas useful;
- work at every scale;
