I've been thinking about starting a blog for a very long time (and I mean loong), but I've always got stuck with the idea that I've nothing to tell. Also my designer's taste got in the way, saying there was no good platform for writing.

Then, one Sunday, I finally did something that a lot of builders do: build their own CMS and blog because they're not happy with what's out there. I think the same thing happens with calendar and to-do apps â€” every developer and designer has designed a better to-do app.

With the help from ChatGPT 4, I created a Jekyll-based website to publish Markdown files (I love [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)) via GitHub.

This will be my learning log to document learnings from others.

Now that the introductions are out of the way, I recently finished reading "[Marx in the Anthropocene](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/marx-in-the-anthropocene/D58765916F0CB624FCCBB61F50879376)". And I have many thoughts.
